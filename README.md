# Brain games
#### Here is my first project in js - brain games - pack of mini arithmetic games which includes:
* brain-even game: Answer "yes" if the number is even, otherwise answer "no"
* brain-calc game: What is the result of the expression?
* brain-gcd game: Find the greatest common divisor of given numbers.
* brain-progression game: What number is missing in the progression?
* brain-prime game: Answer "yes" if given number is prime. Otherwise answer "no".

#### Instaling 
 download or clone  repository on your computer, then: 
* you can immediately play by the command in console  ***make start*** 
		*or*
* locally install by the command  ***make publish && sudo npm link*** in console
If you have locally installed the packege you can run brain games by the command ***brain-games***
